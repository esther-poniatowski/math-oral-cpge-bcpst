# ROADMAP

# To Do

- [ ] Move preamble and macros into the submodule since it might be used in all exercise sheet
      projects.
- [ ] Implement the recommended practices for dependencies in the submodule macros.
- [ ] Improve the style of the sheet header (title).
- [ ] Improve the page footer: add author, add total number of pages, add separating line.
- [ ] Reformulate corrections in "geometie".
- [ ] Add indentation for questions to align after the question number.
- [ ] Try a method to extract the location from the compiled file (see`test_2.tex`). Especially
      since the new "wip" folders impose an additional nesting level for their files.
- [ ] Improve dependencies handling in figures.
